# Glaucoma Detection using CNN – Deep Learning Project

## Problem Statement
Glaucoma is a leading cause of preventable blindness. The objective of this project is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify retinal images and support early detection.

## Data
- Retinal fundus imaging dataset (labelled)
- Images preprocessed for model input (resize/normalisation)
- Note: Dataset is not included in this repository due to usage restrictions

## Approach
- Image preprocessing (resize, normalisation, augmentation)
- CNN model design and training
- Validation and performance evaluation
- Error analysis and model iteration

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
- NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
- Jupyter/Colab

## Results
- Achieved 85% diagnostic accuracy on evaluation data (academic project result)
- Demonstrated end-to-end deep learning workflow from preprocessing to evaluation

## Repository Structure
- `/notebooks` – Model training and evaluation notebook(s)
- `/src` – Model scripts (optional)
- `/visuals` – Sample charts (accuracy/loss curves) or results screenshots
- `/data` – Dataset notes (data not publicly shared)

## Notes
This project is presented as a portfolio artifact focusing on applied deep learning workflow and evaluation. Exact dataset files are not published.
